# RayTrace

An implementation of the standard ray-tracing techniques in Java. The code is modularized, to handle objects of any topology, or texture.

Imagine you wanted to stare down a hall of mirrors. The ceiling is blue, and the walls are red, but in front of and behind you are mirrors...
Also, like any normal room, there's a polished sphere hovering near the mirror... This room, complete with optimal mirrors is easy to simulate!!
